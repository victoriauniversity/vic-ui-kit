# Victoria UI library


**Victoria UI library is a set of modules providing base CSS, JavaScript and base assets (fonts, images) required to build websites and applications affiliated with [Victoria University of Wellington](www.victoria.ac.nz)**.

By building new web projects on top of this library, developers can quickly reuse out of the box layouts and UI components, gaining following advantages:

 * Saving a lot of development time by not 'reinventing the wheel'
 * Using code that has been extensively tested and conforms to the front end best practices
 * Consistent 'Victoria look' (brand colours, paddings, typography, fonts and many more)
 * New features, improvements and bug fixes with simple update (can be automated)





## Quick Start
