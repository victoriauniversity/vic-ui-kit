# Quick Start

To quickly include Victoria's UI styles in your project, copy-paste the following code snippet into the ```<head>``` element in your project:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://github.com/victoriauniversity/vuw-styleguide/blob/gh-pages/assets/toolkit/styles/toolkit.css">
```

If you wish to use complex components that **require JavaScript** to work properly (see [Components](/components.html)), include library with scripts as well: 

```html
<script src="https://github.com/victoriauniversity/vuw-styleguide/blob/gh-pages/assets/toolkit/scripts/toolkit.js"></script>
```
