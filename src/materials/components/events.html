                    <p>This study considers interwar Czechoslovakia’s easternmost province of Ruthenia, today a region of Ukraine, as an example of colonial administrative practices and mentality in a European context. Czechs and Rusyns shared a common Slavic ethnicity, yet the vast difference in their economic and cultural levels at the outset of the republic led to the establishment of a colonial framework in the Czech media and political administration.</p>
